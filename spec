Thank you for your time. My name is Haley Arnold and I am the Operations Manager for The Launch Express. 

As a part of our hiring process we would like you to build a short, two-page survey with five questions per page, and each question weighed from zero to five that a user can fill out and see a statistics summary of the average answers per question for all users.

The user should go to the app, register with either email/password, Google, or Facebook (you may implement whichever of the 3 methods you are most comfortable with), fill out the 2-page questionnaire, and see a statistics breakdown of values per question of all entries filled in the form of a chart of your choice.

In addition to normal users, there should also be administrator users who can complete the survey but also see an additional page that contains the list of users that registered but did not fill out the survey. This page is hidden for non-administrator users and they may never access it.

The technologies you should use are:

MySQL for the Database
PHP7 and Symfony4 for the backend
jQuery 3 and Bootstrap 4 for the frontend

The last page, the statistics breakdown, should just be a simple chart (whatever you can think of as sensible statistics for a survey), implemented in your charting library of choice (ChartJS is a good candidate, but you can use whatever you are most comfortable with).

The emphasis here is not on the UI or fancy animations, but on designing and building a complete and simple solution that does one thing and does it well.

If you have any questions, or if you feel the requirements are unclear, please do not hesitate to contact me and I or our CIO, Milos, will get back with you.
